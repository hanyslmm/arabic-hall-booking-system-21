## Technical Details

### Authentication & Permissions
```typescript
// Enhanced permission system
const isOwner = userRole === USER_ROLES.OWNER || appRole === 'ADMIN';
const isManager = userRole === USER_ROLES.MANAGER;
const isAdmin = isOwner || isManager;
```

### Database Policies
```sql
-- All users can view data
CREATE POLICY "Users can view bookings"
ON public.bookings FOR SELECT
USING (auth.uid() IS NOT NULL);

-- Only admins can modify data
CREATE POLICY "Admins can manage bookings"
ON public.bookings FOR INSERT
WITH CHECK (has_full_access());
```

### UI Consistency
```css
/* Consistent border styling */
.border-consistent {
  @apply border border-border rounded-lg;
}

.card-border-fix {
  @apply border border-border rounded-lg shadow-sm;
}
```

## Verification Steps

### 1. Test Admin Access
1. Login with admin account
2. Navigate to Bookings page - should see all bookings
3. Navigate to Students page - should see all students
4. Navigate to Users page - should be able to manage users
5. Check that all navigation items are visible

### 2. Test Permissions
- **Owner Role**: Full access to all features
- **Manager Role**: Full access to all features
- **Teacher Role**: Limited access to their classes
- **Space Manager**: Read-only access to resources
- **Read Only**: View-only access

### 3. Test UI Elements
1. Check for duplicate notification bells
2. Verify consistent border styling
3. Test mobile navigation
4. Ensure proper responsive design
